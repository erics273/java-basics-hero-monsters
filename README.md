## Let's create some classes!

- Create an abstract class called "LivingThing".
	- Create 2 public properties called "name" and "health"
	- Give the class a constructor that sets the classes two public properties.
 	
- Let's extend our abstract class "LivingThing" with a new class called Monster.
	- The monster constructor should take an extra parameter called "classification" that sets a private instance variable of classification
	- Create a getting for the private classification
  	
- Create three Monster instances in the main method of App.java
	- Be sure to set each object's name and health!
 
- Now add each of your monsters to an ArrayList called "monsters"

- Loop through your array list and print out each monsters name, health, and classification
